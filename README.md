For this website, I really wanted to create something that was very visually appealing. I also wanted to recreate a sort of list that people in my age demographic would enjoy to learn about for fun -- there are other 'top 10' types of list in regards to food, cafes, and aesthetic spots. 

This is obviously for fun, and not to be taken too seriously, but it does provide some helpful tips for those who maybe live in Pittsburgh or are visiting Pittsburgh and want to know where they can get some nice photographs. 

I used the color palette of white, beige, yellow, and rose pink to lighten the mood and provide a very bright and fresh interface. I used the font Courier New because I also feel like it fits in with the 'aesthetic' of the list and lightens the tone. 

For every page, I included a short description about the spot and links to return back to the landing page (home), previous suggestion, next suggestion, and total sitemap. I played around with a CSS Float layout, which was quite challenging as some elements of my layout kept on being affected with every minor change I did with sizing. 

While I would have liked to add more images of the actual locations, I wasn't able to do so due to being quarantined from COVID19. However, once able to, I'd like to go out and visit each location again to take the pictures. 

Overall, I am pretty happy with this basic site. In my spare time, I would like to add JS into my site to be able to do some cool animations and more hover effects!
